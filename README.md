It fetches data from dev.to every 5 seconds. I coudn't deploy cloud functions to yandex console because of issues with kaspi card(and how I know it needs manual accept from yandex). Task was unclear, hope that all ok

Start w `npm i` and `yarn start:dev` , then send get reqs to localhost:3000/devto/data
